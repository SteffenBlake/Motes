### Motes 😎
Motes is a new Emoji based programming language, designed for simplicity and fun! If you've ever been interested in learning to program, or are a experienced programmer looking for a fun new way to mess around, then Motes is for you!

### Get Started! 😄

Step 1: Grab your latest install zip of Motes from the link below!

Step 2: Unzip the folder to a spot wherever you please, then open it and run Installer.exe located within. This will setup your version of Motes and get everything ready.

Step 3: Make sure you restart your computer for the changes to apply!

Step 4: Download your choice of editor. It needs to be capable of handling emoji! [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) works quite well!

Step 5: Create a .mot file anywhere you like on your computer and put some code in it (keep reading to learn how it works!)

Step 6: Save it, then go to where you saved it and run the .mot file (double clicking should do the job!)

It's that easy!

### How to Program 👌

Motes supports a wide range of Emoji, but first and foremost you should know that any non-emoji you put in the document won't hurt anything. You can add spaces and even new lines and the interpretter won't notice a difference. Have at it!

The first thing to understand is Motes has no form of variables. Instead you have whats called the **Index**, which is an infinitely long list of numbers you can edit. You start with your **Pointer** (👆) pointing to the very first number in the list. You can move your **Pointer** left and right on the **Index**, and you can increase and decrease values of the **Index** you are pointing at.

Second you have two pieces of **Memory**, these are called the **Reader** and the **Function**, but you can just remember them as their emoji values, 📖 and 🌀

Whats the difference? Well you can Read(📖) *and* Write(✍) to 💾, but you can *only* 📖 from 🌀. How do you change the value of 🌀? We'll get to that later!

Motes seperates Emoji into the following categories:

## Data 👓
These are a lot like your toolbox Emoji. All the ones listed here let you change and modify the data you have going on in your program. Saving, Reading, and Writing are all handled here!

# 👈/👉 : Move Pointer
These values move your Pointer left and right. They're two of your most important Emoji!

# 👍/👎 : Increase/Decrease
These friends will increases or decrease the value of your current index you are pointing at by 1. These two are also very important!

# 💩 : Reset
This silly little friend will set the value of your current index to 0, no matter what it's like right now!

# ✍ : Write
If you want to save something for later, this character will copy the value at your current index to Memory

# 📖 : Read
Reading is important! This value does the opposite of write, it takes whatever you have in Memory and copies it to your current pointed index!

# 🌀 : Function Read
This tricky fellow will do the same thing as 📖, except it reads from your **Function Memory**. To put something in there though you'll need to learn more about functions. We'll get to that in a bit down below!

# 🔃 : Swap
If you want to copy a value to Memory without losing what you had before, this little friend will switch places for your index and your Memory. So if you're pointing at a 5 and you have a 7 in memory, the two will switch places!

# 🔚 : Return
This handy friend will make you point back to the very first index. So you can rest assured that no matter how lost you are, you can always use 🔚 to get back home safely!

# 🎲 : Random!
This one is funny, it'll make your current index value a totally random number between 0 and 99! I wonder what kind of cool things you can do with that?

## I/O 💻
You'll notice right away when you work with Motes,

# 💯 : This
